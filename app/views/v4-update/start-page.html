      <p class="govuk-body">You need to update the AML registration details if the agent has registered with a different AML supervisory body, or the AML membership number changes. </p>

      <p>The agent must always be registered with at least one AML supervisory body. </p>

      <p>If the agent has registered with a new AML supervisory body, you’ll need to tell us the:</p>
                 <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>name of the AML supervisory body</li>

                </ul>
     <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Updating details for an existing registration </h3>  
     <p>You cannot edit the details for an existing registration. If there has been a change, for example, the agent has a new membership number or ID from the supervisory body, you will need to add this as a new registration. </p>
     <p>You’ll need to delete the previous details once you’ve added the new ones. </p>
