      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p>We'll email you to let you know if your application to register an authorised agent has been accepted or rejected.</p>
      
      <p> We'll process the application as soon as possible. This is a new service, so we're not able to tell you exactly how long this will take.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If the application is accepted</h2>

      <p>We'll add your business to the list of Companies House authorised agents. </p>

      <p>You'll be able to sign in to your Companies House account to access your authorised agent account. You can: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>add people who work for the business to the account</li>
  <li>update the authorised agent details</li>
  <li>use our service to tell us you have verified someone’s identity - this will be available from XX DATE</li>

</ul>



        <p class="govuk-body">We’ll also send you an authorised agent number. From XX DATE, you'll need this to file on paper or using software. </p>




      <p>We'll email the authorised agent number to <strong>james@morrisaccounting.com</strong>. You should keep the number secure and must not share it with anyone outside of your organisation. </p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If the application is rejected</h2>
      <p>We'll email you at <strong>james@morrisaccounting.com</strong> to explain what to do next.</p>
