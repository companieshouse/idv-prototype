      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p>We'll email you to let you know if your application to register an ACSP has been accepted or rejected. We'll process the application as soon as possible. However, because this is a new service, we're not yet able to tell you exactly how long this will take.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens if the application is accepted</h2>
      <p>We'll send the ACSP reference number to the registered address you've provided.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens if the application is rejected</h2>
      <p>If it's rejected, we'll email you at presenter@accountants.com to explain what to do next.</p>
