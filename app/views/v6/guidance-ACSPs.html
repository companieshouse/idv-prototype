      <h2 id="service" class="govuk-heading-m">What this service is for </h2>

      <p>Use this service to register your business as an authorised agent with Companies House. Authorised agents are also known as Authorised Corporate Service Providers (ACSPs).</p>
 
  <p>Agents must register with Companies House to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>form companies or registrable partnerships on behalf of clients</li>
        <li>file on behalf of clients</li>
        <li>verify someone's identity for Companies House</li>
      </ul>



      <h2 id="how-to-verify" class="govuk-heading-m">Who can use this service </h3>
      
      <p>To register as an authorised agent, your business must be:</p>
         <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>registered in the UK</li>
            <li>registered with an anti-money laundering (AML) supervisory body</li>
          </ul>


      <p>You'll need to be a relevant officer for the business to use this service. This means you are one of the following:</p>  

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>director</li>
        <li>general partner</li>
        <li>partner</li>
        <li>sole trader</li>
      </ul>


      <h2 id="acsp-guidance" class="govuk-heading-m">What information you need to submit</h3>

<!-- OPTION 1-->
  <!--
      <p>You will need the:  </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>business name, or your own name if you're a sole trader</li>
        <li>UK registered address, or your correspondence address if you're a sole trader</li>
        <li>names of all AML supervisory bodies the business is registered with </li>
        <li>AML membership numbers</li>
      </ul>


      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
These details must be the same as those held by the AML supervisory bodies.
</div>

     
     <p>If you’re registering a limited company, limited liability partnership (LLP), limited partnership or Scottish limited partnership (SLP), you'll also need:</p> 

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the company number</li>
        <li>the company authentication code</li>

        <p>You will need to <a href="https://prove-your-identity-prototype.herokuapp.com/v5/pre-one-login/start">verify your identity with Companies House</a> before you can use this service.</p>

      <p>When you verify, you'll get a Companies House user ID. You will need your user ID to apply to register as an authorised agent.</p>

      <p>You'll also need to tell us your:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

                <li>AML membership numbers</li>
              </ul>



<div class="govuk-inset-text">

          <p>You'll be able to sign in to your Companies House account to access online services for authorised agents.</p>


      <p>We’ll email you the authorised agent number. You should keep the number secure and must not share it with anyone outside of your organisation. You will need to use it: </p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>for paper filings</li>
            <li>to update the authorised agent’s details </li>
          </ul>





       <h3 id="identity-checks" class="govuk-heading-s">Add or remove members who work for the authorised agent</h3>

            </ul>


   <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What you'll need to do as an authorised agent</h3>


      <p>You must provide details about any changes to the agent's AML registration. This includes if the:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>agent is no longer registered with an AML supervisory body </li>
        <li>AML registration details change, for example if the agent registers with a different AML supervisory body</li>
      </ul>


       <h3 id="identity-checks" class="govuk-heading-s">Identity verification checks</h3>

      <p>Authorised agents do not have to offer identity verification to their clients. However, they will still need to register to file on behalf of companies or registrable partnerships.</p>
