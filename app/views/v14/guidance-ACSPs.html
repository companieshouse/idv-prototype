      <h2 id="what" class="govuk-heading-m">What a Companies House authorised agent is 
 </h2>

      <p>Companies House authorised agents, also known as Authorised Corporate Service Providers (ACSPs), are businesses that are covered by Money Laundering Regulations. For example, they could be: </p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>company formation agents</li>
              <li>solicitors </li>
              <li>accountants</li>
            </ul>





      <h2 id="who" class="govuk-heading-m">Who needs to register as an authorised agent</h2>

      
      <p>Businesses must register as an authorised agent to be able to <a href="">verify the identity of clients for Companies House</a>. </p>

    <!--  <p>The service to <a href="">tell Companies House you’ve verified someone’s identity</a> will be available from XX DATE. </p> -->

      <p>From XX DATE, businesses will also need to register to be able to file on behalf of clients.</p>

      <p>To apply to register, you must have a senior role in the business. For example, you must be a director if you’re registering a limited company, or a general partner if you're registering a limited partnership (LP). </p>

      <p>You’ll be able to add other people who work for the business to the authorised agent account once you’ve registered. This will allow them to access services on behalf of the authorised agent. </p>

      <p>Read the <a href="guidance-applying-to-register">guidance on applying to register as an authorised agent</a> to check if you can apply. </p>





      <h2 id="account" class="govuk-heading-m">How to use your authorised agent account</h2>

      <p>If your application to register a business as an authorised agent is accepted, you’ll be able to access the authorised agent account when you sign in to your Companies House account. </p>

            <h3 id="submit-information" class="govuk-heading-s">Add and remove users</h3>

      <p>You should add people who work for the business if they need to verify peoples’ identity for Companies House. They will not need to verify their identity.</p>

    <p>You can manage which other services the user can access by selecting their role when you add them. You can add users as:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>account owners – they will be able to update the authorised agent details, and add and remove all users </li>
              <li>administrators – they will be able to add and remove administrators and standard users</li>
              <li>standard users – they will not be able to add and remove other users</li>
            </ul>

    <p>You can remove users from the account at any time. Once you remove a user, they will no longer be able to access the account or services for the authorised agent.</p>



       <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Update the authorised agent's details  </h3>

       <p>Account owners can use this service to tell us about changes to the authorised agent's details.</p>

        <p>If the business is no longer acting as an authorised agent, you will need to <a href="">contact Companies House</a>. We will close the account and remove it from the public list of authorised agents.  </p>




<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens if the authorised agent is suspended or removed</h3>

      <p>We may suspend or stop your business from acting as an authorised agent if you do not comply with your legal responsibilities.</p>

<p>Users that have been added to the account will not be able to access the service to tell Companies House they've verified someone's identity.</p>
<p>We'll also publish information to show that the authorised agent has been suspended. We'll publish the agent's name and the date it was suspended. </p>


<p>If we need to stop your business from acting as an authorised agent, we'll: </p>

              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>remove it from our list of authorised agents</li>
                <li>send an email to the agent's correspondence email address</li>
                <li>close the online account - users will not be able to access the agent account or services</li>
                <li>publish the business name and the date it stopped being an authorised agent</li>
              </ul>



      <h2 id="responsilibilities" class="govuk-heading-m">Authorised agent legal responsibilities</h2>

      <p>As a Companies House authorised agent, the business must comply with the following legal responsibilities:</p>


<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>The business must always be registered with at least one Anti-Money Laundering (AML) supervisory body.</li>

        <li>about your filings with Companies House</li>
        <li>about identity checks, if the agent verifies someone’s identity for Companies House</li>
