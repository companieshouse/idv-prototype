      <h2 id="what" class="govuk-heading-m">What a Companies House authorised agent is 
 </h2>

<p>In future, businesses will need to register to be able to file with Companies House on behalf of clients. This is a new legal requirement and will help us to know who's filing information on the public register.</p>
<p>Authorised agents are known as Authorised Corporate Service Providers (ACSPs) in legislation. To register as an authorised agent, a business must be supervised by a UK Anti-Money Laundering (AML) supervisory body. For example, this could include:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>company formation agents</li>
              <li>solicitors </li>
              <li>accountants</li>
            </ul>

   <!--   <p>To be able to register as an authorised agent with Companies House, also known as Authorised Corporate Service Providers (ACSPs), businesses must be supervised by an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) supervisory body. For example, they could be: </p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>company formation agents</li>
              <li>solicitors </li>
              <li>accountants</li>
            </ul> -->





      <h2 id="who" class="govuk-heading-m">Who needs to register as an authorised agent</h2>

      
      <p>For now, only businesses that intend to <a href="">verify the identity of clients for Companies House</a> need to register. </p>

    <!--  <p>The service to <a href="">tell Companies House you’ve verified someone’s identity</a> will be available from XX DATE. </p> -->

      <p>From spring 2026, businesses that file any other information on behalf of clients will also need to register.</p>

      <p>To apply to register, you must have a senior role in the business. For example, you must be a director if you’re registering a limited company, a general partner if you're registering a limited partnership (LP), or a member of the partnership if you're registering a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). Sole traders can register themselves as an authorised agent.</p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">

      <p>Once the business is registered, we'll create an online account for the authorised agent. You’ll be able to add other people who work for the business which will allow them to use services for the authorised agent. </p>
</div>
      <p>Read the <a href="guidance-applying-to-register">guidance on applying to register as an authorised agent</a> to check if you can apply. </p>





      <h2 id="account" class="govuk-heading-m">How to use your authorised agent account</h2>

      <p>You’ll be able to access the authorised agent account when you sign in to your Companies House account. </p>

            <h3 id="submit-information" class="govuk-heading-s">Add and remove users</h3>

      <p>You should add people who work for the business if they need to use Companies House services. They will not need to verify their identity.</p>

    <p>You can manage what users can do by selecting their role when you add them to the account. There are 3 roles users can have for an authorised agent:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>account owners – can update the authorised agent's details, and add and remove all users </li>
              <li>administrators – can add and remove administrators and standard users</li>
              <li>standard users – cannot add and remove other users</li>
            </ul>

    <p>You can remove users from the account at any time. Once you remove a user, they will no longer be able to access the account or services for the authorised agent.</p>



       <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Update the authorised agent's details  </h3>

       <p>An account owner must update the details on the authorised agent account if there are any changes to the information we hold about the business. They must do this within 14 days.</p>

        <p>If the business is no longer acting as an authorised agent, an account owner will need to close the account. and remove it from the public list of authorised agents.  </p>




<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens if we need to suspend or stop your business from acting as an authorised agent</h3>

      <p>We may suspend or stop your business from acting as an authorised agent if you do not comply with your legal responsibilities.</p>

<p>If the authorised agent is suspended, we'll send an email to the agent's correspondence email address to tell you what to do next. </p>

<p>Users that have been added to the account will not be able to access services for authorised agents.</p>
<p>We'll also publish information to show that the authorised agent has been suspended. We'll publish the agent's name and the date it was suspended. </p>

              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>send an email to the agent's correspondence email address</li>
                <li>close the online account - users will not be able to access the agent account or services</li>
                <li>publish the business name and the date it stopped being an authorised agent</li>
              </ul>
