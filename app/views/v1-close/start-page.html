      <p class="govuk-body">Use this service to tell us if MORRIS ACCOUNTING LTD no longer needs to be a Companies House authorised agent. This is also known as an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP).  </p>


         <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>  


      <p>If there are other users who have been added to the account, you should make sure they know they will no longer be able to access the account or services for the authorised agent. </p>


   <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to do</h2>  

      <p>We’ll tell you what happens when you close the agent and ask you to complete a declaration to confirm you understand. Then you’ll need to continue to confirm you want to close it. </p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">

            <p>This will permanently close the authorised agent. You only should continue if you are sure that MORRIS ACCOUNTING LTD no longer needs to file with Companies House on behalf of clients.</p>

     <!--  
      
      <p>Before you continue, you should check if you need to tell other users who have been added to the account that they will no longer be able to access the authorised agent account or services.</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
        <li>get agreement from others to close the account, for example people with senior roles in the business</li>

    <p>We’ll also publish a notice to show the agent has stopped being an authorised agent. We'll publish the:</p>

        <li>name of the business</li>
        <li>date the status changed</li>
