      <p>You will need to keep copies of the documents for 7 years from the date you complete the identity checks.</p>

      <p>You will not need to submit copies when you tell us you've verified someone's identity. However, we will ask for information about the documents. You'll need to give the:</p>

            </ul>
      <p>You will not need to provide a document reference number, expiry date, or country of issue for documents from group B.</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-3">Check the evidence is real</h2>


    <!--  <p>If you're using technology to check evidence, you must make sure the information held in the electronic chip matches the information on the document. </p> -->
      <p>If the evidence is being checked by a person, they must be trained in detecting false documents by a specialist training provider. This could be any organisation that follows the Home Office best practice guide, including: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Home Office (HO)</li>
              <li>National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU)</li>
              <li>National Protective Security Authority (NPSA)</li>
            </ul>


      <p>You should always check identity documents for signs of tampering. You must query if there are any signs of damage to a document, especially if it's in an area where personal details are shown. </p>


      <p>If you have concerns about a document, contact the issuing authority or another authoritative source to check.</p>
      <p>For documents issued by a country outside of the UK, you should contact the relevant embassy if you have concerns.  </p>




      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-4" >Check the identity belongs to the person claiming it </h2>

     <p>You’ll need to check that: </p>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the documents confirm their name and date of birth</li>
  <li>information held in the electronic chip matches the information on the document and the person claiming it, if you're using IDVT to check the document</li> 
            <li>the person physically matches the photo that is on, or goes with the document </li>

          </ul>

          <p>If you are verifying the person remotely, you must make sure they are a real person. You will need to clearly see their face to compare it with the photo that is on the identity document. </p>


   <!--   <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="copies" >Make copies of the identity documents</h2>

 <p>You do not need to submit copies of the documents you use to verify their identity. However, you must keep copies of the documents for 7 years from the date you complete the identity checks.</p>
  
  <p>When you tell us you've verified someone's identity, you'll need to tell us which identity documents you used. For each document, you'll need to give the:</p>
                  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>document reference number, or equivalent</li>
                    <li>expiry date, if the document has one</li>
                    <li>country of issue, if the document has one</li>
                    </ul>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-5">Check the person’s identity has existed over time</h2>

      <p>The following steps will help you to confirm the identity has existed over time. This will lower the risk of you accepting: </p>
             <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>a fake identity</li>
                <li>an identity that belongs to someone who has died</li>
              </ul> -->




      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">1. Check their address history</h3>

      <p>The person will need to give you their address history for the last 12 months. Where possible, you should ask to see documentation to confirm the address history.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2. Check if they have changed their name</h3>
      <p>You must ask the person about any previous name changes. You should ask them to show you documentation to support any changes of name.</p>
      <p>If they cannot show you proof of the name change, you should find out why and consider whether to verify their identity.</p>

       <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">3.	Check if they have regularly interacted with other organisations or people</h3>
      <p>To make sure the identity belongs to a real person, you should ask to see evidence of activity you would expect. </p>

      <p>To do this, you could check:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>a bank or credit card statement for recent transactions</li>
            <li>utility or council tax bills, sent the person’s home address </li>
            <li>if their passport has been used recently or over time </li>
          </ul>

 
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="records" >Keep records of the identity checks</h2>

          
          <p>You must keep records of all checks you complete for 7 years from the date you complete them. This includes copies of the evidence you used to verify their identity. </p> 


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="step-6" >Tell Companies House you have verified someone’s identity</h2>
      
      <p>Once you have verified someone’s identity, you’ll need to use our online service to:</p> 
                          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                            <li>tell us the person’s details</li>
                            <li>tell us which documents you used to verify their identity</li>
                            <li>give details from the identity documents</li>
                            <li>confirm you have completed checks to verify their identity to the required standard</li>

         <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="other">Other ways to verify someone’s identity</h2>
 
         <p>You can use commercial identity providers or platforms to verify someone's identity.</p>
         
         <p> If you do this, you must make sure the provider or platform completes checks that meet the Companies House identity verification standard. You will still need to: </p>
                    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                      <li>keep copies of the documents the person provides to verify their identity for 7 years</li>
                      <li>tell us about the identity checks and documents that were used to verify the person's identity</li>
                      </ul>
          <p>We could suspend or stop an authorised agent if they use a provider that does not meet the standard.</p>


          

         <p>You can also ask people to <a href="">verify their identity directly with Companies House</a>. This is a free service. You will not need to see or keep copies of documents for people who verify using this service.</p>




         <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="cannot">What to do if you cannot verify someone’s identity</h2>
        <p>If you have not been able to verify a person’s identity, you must still keep records of the evidence you used and checks you completed for 7 years. </p>
        <p>It is the person’s responsibility to prove that they are who they say they are. They will need to get documents to be able to verify their identity for Companies House. </p>
        <p>They will need to verify their identity to do any of the following:</p>

             
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>file with Companies House</li>
            <li>be a director</li>
            <li>comply with legal requirements as person with significant control (PSC)</li>
            <li>apply to register as a Companies House authorised agent </li>
          </ul>
