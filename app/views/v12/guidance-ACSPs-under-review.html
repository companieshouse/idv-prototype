      <p>You’ll need to <a href="">verify your identity for Companies House</a>.</p>
      <p> You must do this before you can use the online service to register your business as an authorised agent.</p>


      <h2 id="step3" class="govuk-heading-m">3. Check the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) registration details</h2>


  <p>The business must have been registered with an AML supervisory body for at least 2 weeks before you apply. </p>

      <p>You'll need to tell us the:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>names of the supervisory bodies the business is registered with</li>

                            <li>your practising certificate</li>

                            <li>the supervisory body's online register</li>
                          </ul>
          <p>Your AML supervisory body may have a different name for it, such as:</p>
                           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                            <li>a firm ID or number</li>

                            </ul>

  </div>
</details>



      <p>We'll check the supervisory body has the same name and membership number for your business. You should contact the supervisory body if you need to check your details.</p> 

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Which name we'll check with the supervisory body</h3>

      <p>If you’re applying to register any of the following: </p> 
                           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

                            <li>limited liability partnership (LLP)</li>
                            </ul>
      <p>We'll use the company name that's shown on the <a href="">Companies House register</a>. If the AML registration is in a different name, you should update this to match the company name before you apply.  </p>

            <p>If you’re registering any other type of business, you’ll be able to tell us what name is registered with the AML supervisory body. </p>





      <h2 id="step4" class="govuk-heading-m">4. Give details about your business</h2>

    <h2 id="step5" class="govuk-heading-m">5. After you've registered</h2>

      <p>If your application is accepted, we'll register your business as a Companies House authorised agent. </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Add employees to the agent account</h3>
