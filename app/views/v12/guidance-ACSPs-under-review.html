  <p>The business must have been registered with an AML supervisory body for at least 2 weeks before you apply. </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Which name we'll check with the supervisory body</h3>

      <p>If you’re applying to register any of the following: </p>

      <p>We'll use the company name that's shown on the <a href="">Companies House register</a>. If the AML registration is in a different name, you should update this to match the company name before you apply.  </p>

            <p>If you’re registering any other type of business, you’ll be able to tell us what name is registered with the AML supervisory body. </p> -->





      <h2 id="step4" class="govuk-heading-m">4. Give details about your business</h2>

<p>The details you need to give will depend on the type of business you’re registering.</p>

       <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Limited companies, limited partnerships (LPs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs)</h3>

       
       <p> You'll need to tell us:</p>

              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

                <li>the company number</li>

       <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="sole-trader">Sole traders</h3>

       <p>This means you are self-employed and registered with HMRC for Self Assessment.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Partnerships and other unincorporated entities (not including sole traders)</h3>

<p>You'll need to tell us the:</p>

              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

                  </ul>
  <p>If you are registered with the AML supervisory body with your own name, you'll also need to give your name. Otherwise, we’ll check the AML supervisory body holds the business name. </p>


    <h2 id="step5" class="govuk-heading-m">5. After you've registered</h2>

      <p>If your application is accepted, we'll register your business as a Companies House authorised agent. </p>

      <p>We’ll create an authorised agent account for the business. You’ll be able to access this when you sign in to your Companies House account. </p>


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Add users to the agent account</h3>

      <p>If other people who work for the business need to file with Companies House, you can add them to the account.</p>

      <p>You can choose if you want them to be able to: </p>

              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>verify people's identity for Companies House</li>

                <li>add or remove other users</li>
              </ul>


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What we'll show on the public list of authorised agents</h3>

      <p>We'll show your agent registration status. For example, if you are an active agent, or if you have been suspended or stopped from acting as an authorised agent.</p>


      <p>We’ll also show the: </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

              <li>the town or city of your business address, or your correspondence address if you’re a sole trader</li>
              <li>the names of all AML supervisory bodies your business is registered with</li>

            </ul>

    <h2 id="step6" class="govuk-heading-m">6. Comply with your legal responsibilities</h2>



      <p>You must tell us if there is a change to any of the information you provided when you registered as an authorised agent. If there are changes to your AML registration status or details, you must tell us within 14 days.</p>

      <p>You must provide more information if we ask for it. This could be about:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>your filings with Companies House</li>
        <li>identity checks, if you have verified someone’s identity for Companies House</li>
