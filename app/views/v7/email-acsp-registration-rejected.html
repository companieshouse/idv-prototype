      <p class="govuk-body">You application to register MORRIS ACCOUNTING LTD (02050399) as a Companies House authorised agent was rejected for the following reasons: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

      </ul>



      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will refund the £xx fee.</p>

    
      <p>To register as an authorised agent, you will need to submit a new application with the correct information at: <a class="govuk-link" href="start-page">https://companieshouse.gov.uk/register-authorised-agent</a></p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>form companies and registrable partnerships on behalf of clients</li>
        <li>file on behalf of clients</li>
        <li>verify someone's identity</li>
      </ul> 


      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Update the authorised agent’s details </h2>
      <p>You must provide details about any changes to the agent's Anti-Money Laundering (AML) registration. </p>



      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Tell us you have verified someone’s identity </h2>
      <p>You do not have to offer identity verification to your clients. </p>

      <p>If you choose to verify someone’s identity for the Companies House register, you must keep a copy of any documents you use to check the person’s identity. </p>

      <p>You’ll need to keep these while you have a working relationship and for 5 years after. </p>
